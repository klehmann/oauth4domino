	<p>An OAuth client is any entity connecting to a protected resource on behalf of a specific end user. While our traditional definition
		of an "app" describes what, in the context of OAuth, would be considered a Resource Container, an OAuth client is what a typical end user
		would call an "app", such as a native mobile app connecting to a Domino server on the user's behalf.</p>
